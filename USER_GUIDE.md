## What is Buzzer?

Buzzer is an app that lets you remotely ring devices in your group. It's perfect for:

## Tips & Best Practices

### Keep Your App Open

The #1 reason devices don't ring is because the app was swiped away. To keep the app running:

1. **Open Buzzer** on your home screen
2. **Leave it open** (you can use other apps, it stays running in background)
3. **Don't swipe it away** in the app switcher

**Visual Check:** Look for the battery percentage at the top. If you see Buzzer in the status bar, it's running.

### Internet Connection

Buzzer needs internet to work. Make sure:
- ✅ You're connected to WiFi or cellular data
- ✅ You have a strong signal
- ✅ Your internet is fast enough (even 3G works)

### Device Naming

Good device names help everyone find the right phone quickly:
- ✅ "Sarah's iPhone 14"
- ✅ "Dad's Work Phone"
- ✅ "Kids iPad"
- ❌ "My Phone" (too vague)
- ❌ "Device 1" (confusing)

### Group Security

- **Only share your group code** with people you trust
- **Only add real group members** - each device should belong to a real person
- **Keep your password private** - don't share your login
- **Leave groups you no longer want to be in**

### Testing

When you first set up Buzzer:
1. **Register your device** in the group
2. **Ask a group member to ring your phone**
3. **Test that audio plays** (even on silent!)
4. **Leave the app open** and check it still works after 5 minutes
